# Club-Project
Link: http://cis5800site.gear.host/index.aspx

## A class project
The work was supposed to be divided between me (on backend and mid-tier) and a front-end developer.
However, I recreated the whole thing from front to back just to practice with full-stack development.

##Content
The purpose of this was to create a site for clubs to advertise their events to students. 
There is an admin account for each club. These accounts allow the clubs to add/edit/delete their own events. 
There is a master admin to add/delete club admins.
